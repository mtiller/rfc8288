## RFC 8288

This repository is effectively a fork of
https://github.com/tniswong/go.rfcx/tree/master/rfc8288 by
[`tniswong`](https://github.com/tniswong). That respository hadn't been touched
in many years. So I forked it so I could upgrade the code to leverage Go modules
and in the process I've switched the testing framework involved to
[Testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify). I have, of course, retained
Tim's copyright in the [`LICENSE.md`](./LICENSE.md) file to reflect that the
majority of the work here was his.
